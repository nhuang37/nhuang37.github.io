Therefore, it is more efficient to perform lane and vehicle detection in the vehicle coordinate system by projecting the front-view images to the bird’s eye view (BEV).

Classical random forest could not address the spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics present in our data. My innovative approach was to fit sub-models on local neighbourhood and further incorporate temporal features, inspired by [1]. We discovered how crucial climate drivers instead of land-use factors are to vegetation trend changes. The ability to model spatial-heterogeneity and temporal trends suggested more effective conservation policies for the protected areas and the great migration.\nThe stippling plot above shows the regional heterogeity of vegetation trend in Tanzania. The measure of vegetation is Leaf Area Index (LAI) from remote sensing product LAI3G. The trend is decomposed at each pixel level, using data from 1982-2010. Green pixel indicates an increasing LAI trend while brown pixel represents decreasing.\nReferences:  Stefanos Georganos, Tais Grippa, Assane Niang Gadiaga, Catherine Linard, Moritz Lennert, Sabine Vanhuysse, Nicholus Odhiambo Mboga, Eléonore Wolff, and Stamatis Kalogirou.

We compare the performance of three matrix imputation methods (Soft-Impute, SoftImpute-concat, Multiple Imputation) on different types of missing data patterns using both synthetic and real datasets. Although no method is found to perform significantly better under all circumstances, SoftImpute-concat indeed outperforms original SoftImpute when missing is not at random (NMAR) on our data. Besides, SoftImpute-concat has more robust performance than SoftImpute when missing rate increases. However, no theoretical proof of SoftImpute-concat superior performance under NMAR setting is given so far. Therefore, we discuss possible reasons based on a toy example.\nData  Simulated Data The MovieLens small dataset includes 100,000 ratings (ranging from 0.5 to 5) of 9000 movies by 600 users EMBARC study, an 8-week randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of sertraline enrolled about 300 patients with Major Depressive Disorder  Algorithm  SoftImpute SoftImpute-Concat Multiple Imputation  ","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"93d5efb574cfa39953428d8b5c02456f","permalink":"https://nhuang37.github.io/project/matrix/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/matrix/","section":"project","summary":"A study of three matrix imputation methods on different types of missing data patterns","tags":["Representation Learning"],"title":"Matrix Completion for Different Missing Data Patterns","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Inspired from my volunteering experiences in South Africa.
