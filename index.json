Therefore, it is more efficient to perform lane and vehicle detection in the vehicle coordinate system by projecting the front-view images to the birdâ€™s eye view (BEV).

We compare the performance of three matrix imputation methods (Soft-Impute, SoftImpute-concat, Multiple Imputation) on different types of missing data patterns using both synthetic and real datasets. Although no method is found to perform significantly better under all circumstances, SoftImpute-concat indeed outperforms original SoftImpute when missing is not at random (NMAR) on our data. Besides, SoftImpute-concat has more robust performance than SoftImpute when missing rate increases. However, no theoretical proof of SoftImpute-concat superior performance under NMAR setting is given so far. Therefore, we discuss possible reasons based on a toy example.\nData  Simulated Data The MovieLens small dataset includes 100,000 ratings (ranging from 0.5 to 5) of 9000 movies by 600 users EMBARC study, an 8-week randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of sertraline enrolled about 300 patients with Major Depressive Disorder  Algorithm  SoftImpute SoftImpute-Concat Multiple Imputation  ","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"93d5efb574cfa39953428d8b5c02456f","permalink":"https://nhuang37.github.io/project/matrix/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/matrix/","section":"project","summary":"A study of three matrix imputation methods on different types of missing data patterns","tags":["Representation Learning"],"title":"Matrix Completion for Different Missing Data Patterns","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Inspired from my volunteering experiences in South Africa.
